alpha_beta.R showed the alpha diversity and beta diversity of copepod GMC.

asv_aa_at_all.R showed the changes of copepod GMC at ASV level in response to toxic algal diets.

dino_16s_relative_abundance.R showed copepod GMC composition based on 16s rDNA sequencing.

distinct ASVs between treatment.R is about the disimilarity of two copepods under different diets.

I am looking forward to consulting and discussing my codes with you all!
